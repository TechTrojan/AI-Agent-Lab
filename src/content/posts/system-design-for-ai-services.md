AI services should inherit proven distributed systems principles.

## Core patterns

1. **Async boundaries** around model calls
2. **Idempotent processors** for replay-safe workflows
3. **Circuit breakers and retries** with strict budgets
4. **Trace correlation** across request, retrieval, and generation

## Practical takeaway

A reliable AI system is mostly a reliable platform with an AI capability attached, not the other way around.
